#### Setting up Environments and Installing Packages in Anaconda Prompt ####

#To install a package to a specific environment:
First, activate environment in Anaconda Prompt: conda activate MovingPandasWS (MovingPandasWS is the name of the environment)

Second, install the necessary packages: conda install matplotlib (matplotlib is the name of the package)
